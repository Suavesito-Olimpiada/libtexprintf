New in version 1.23
- support more symbols.
- Allow switching to math mode within a text block using $...$, e.g. \text{for $i<10$ do...}
- Better handle the \over and \choose operators. These operators are "greedy", which 
  previous libtexprintf did not handle. Thus:
  a + b\over c
  gave
    
      b
  a + ─
      c
  
  instead of the correct
  
  a + b
  ─────
    c
