directory with tests.
the eqxx.tex are a rather arbitrary collection 
of latex equations. The corresponding ref files 
are libtexprintf renderings thereof, which at 
some point in time I felt were OK.
The font.tex file is used for testing the 
different font styles. 

Add tests:
Before ypou add tests, make sure the current 
tests are passed, i.e. run (in root directory) 
>> make check
Then add your xx.tex file, and run:
>> ./runtest.sh ref
and
>> ./runtest.sh ASCII ref
This will generate the corresponding ref files.
Inspect the ref files whether the output is OK.
If not either:
- fix libtexprintf
- fix the tex file
- create an issue/bug report
   
Once the test runs correctly, add the test to 
configure.ac. You need to create links to the 
tex and ref files there. This is to ensure the 
test also runs for out of source tree builds. 
Do a "make distcheck" to ensure all things are 
set up correctly.
