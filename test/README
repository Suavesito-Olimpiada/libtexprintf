the main testsuite is in testsuite.txt
See description there on how to create tests
The tests are run using the test.awk script. To use it do:
./test.awk testsuite.txt
You may pass some arguments. Most notably the executable to use:
./test.awk -v exe="somepath/utftex" testsuite.txt
and whether you want a log file for each failed test
./test.awk -v debug=1 testsuite.txt
